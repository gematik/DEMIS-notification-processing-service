/**
 * Provides the mapping of the concept maps 'NotificationCategoryToTransmissionCategory' or
 * 'NotificationDiseaseCategoryToTransmissionCategory'. The mapping is not contained in NPS rather
 * it is defined in the profiles and requested from FUTS.
 *
 * <p>Caching strategy: To avoid a request per each notification and since the mapping is almost
 * static, caching is required. Every 30 minutes (configurable via cron in application.yaml) all
 * entries of the two concept maps are requested, which means 2 rest calls. Is done in an extra
 * thread independent of the notification processing. If the request was successfully, the whole map
 * is replaced otherwise not, i.e. the old cached map will be continued to be used. At start up we
 * load the mapping. If not successfully, we retry on first request.
